#  Fashion Page — React Project

This is a fashion-themed web page built using **React**. The project was focused not only on UI design but also on learning and practicing **React Hooks** to build interactive and dynamic components.

##  Features

- Beautiful and responsive fashion layout
- Dynamic components powered by React Hooks
- Clean structure with reusable components


##  What I Learned

While building this project, I gained hands-on experience with:

- `useState` for managing component state
- `useEffect` for handling side effects (like data fetching or DOM interactions)
- `useRef` for direct DOM access
- Component reusability and props
- React component lifecycle concepts
- Basic routing using `react-router-dom` 

This project helped me improve my understanding of how hooks make React apps cleaner and easier to manage.
